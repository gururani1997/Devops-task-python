# Student Grades and File Handling Programs

This repository contains three simple Python programs demonstrating basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, dictionaries, and file handling.

## 1. Grade Checker

**Description:**  
A program that takes a numerical score as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

- 90 and above: **A**
- 80 to 89: **B**
- 70 to 79: **C**
- 60 to 69: **D**
- Below 60: **F**

**Concepts Used:**

- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- User input handling
- Comparison operators

## 2. Student Grades Management

**Description:**  
A program that uses a dictionary to store student names and their grades. It allows the user to:

- Add a new student and grade
- Update an existing studentâ€™s grade
- Print all student grades

The program uses a menu-driven interface and basic `if-else` logic for operations.

**Concepts Used:**

- Dictionaries
- Loops and conditionals
- Input validation

## 3. Write to a File

**Description:**  
A simple program that creates a text file and writes some content into it.

**Concepts Used:**

- File handling (`open()`, `write()`, `close()`)
- String formatting
- Basic input/output operations

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Run each Python file in your Python environment (version 3.x recommended).
3. Follow on-screen prompts for interactive programs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
