2. Student Grades Management Using Dictionary

Description:
This program manages student names and their grades using a Python dictionary, allowing the user to add new students, update grades, and view all records.

How it works:

A dictionary is created with student names as keys and their grades as values.

The program displays a menu with options to:

Add a new student and grade (checks to prevent duplicates)

Update an existing studentâ€™s grade (only if the student exists)

Print all student grades

User selections control the program flow through if-else logic inside a loop, enabling multiple operations until the user decides to exit.

Concepts used:

Dictionary operations (add, update, iterate)

Control flow with if-elif-else and loops (while)

Input validation and error handling
