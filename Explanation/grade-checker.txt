1. Grade Checker

Description:
This program takes a numerical score as input from the user and prints the corresponding grade based on a defined grading scale.

How it works:

The user inputs a score (usually between 0 and 100).

Using a series of if-else statements, the program checks the score against different ranges:

90 or above: Grade "A"

80 to 89: Grade "B"

70 to 79: Grade "C"

60 to 69: Grade "D"

Below 60: Grade "F"

The program then outputs the grade corresponding to the input score.

Concepts used:

Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

User input handling (input())

Comparison operators (>=)
