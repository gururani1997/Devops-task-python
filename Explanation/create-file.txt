3. Write to a File

Description:
This program creates a text file and writes some content into it using Pythonâ€™s file handling capabilities.

How it works:

The program opens (or creates) a text file in write mode using the open() function.

It writes strings of text into the file using the write() method.

The file is closed using the close() method to ensure all data is properly saved.

Concepts used:

File handling (open(), write(), close())

String manipulation (adding newline characters for formatting)

Basic input/output operations
